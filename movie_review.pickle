Disney-Pixar has repeatedly raised the bar of animated movies by telling stories that would appeal to children and adults alike. But their past couple of films seemed to miss that crucial element of storytelling, leading to some sub-par entries in their otherwise impressive catalogue. 'Coco' is an original tale, and a highly imaginative one at that, by writer/ co-director Adrian Molina. Based in Mexico, it introduces us to the Rivera family who makes shoes for a living and everyone absolutely despises anything related to music. Except for little Miguel Rivera, who shines shoes but aspires to be a musician. Through the course of the film, Miguel enters the Land of the Dead and learns the truth about who his family really is.

'Coco' is colorful and vibrant, blending a number of unique personalities and vivid landscapes. Director Lee Unkrich keeps the narrative taut; throwing in a couple of twists along with some truly powerful moments that will invariably pull at your heartstrings. The voice acting from an all-Latino cast is top-notch, with Anthony Gonzalez's Miguel being endearing. Gael Garcia Bernal & Benjamin Bratt who play Hector and Ernesto de la Cruz respectively make each character unique. Renee Victor as the wisecracking, feisty Abuelita is a treat. Even Dante, Miguel's pet street dog who doesn't have any lines, is adorable and plays a vital role too.

Going beyond the usual 'follow your dreams' mantra, 'Coco' has multiple messages to take home. It's also a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being a celebrity, and more importantly an ode to family, especially the ones who aren't with us anymore. Even though it's primarily set in Mexico and steeped in their culture, anyone who values family, and music, will connect with it immediately. Expect guitar sales to spike as musically-inclined kids will be inspired to take up lessons. The fact that even some adults might be tempted to do the same, is a testament to why this film works so well. 'Coco' shows us what Disney-Pixar does best, and reminds us that it still hasn't lost its touch. Take your kids along for it, and if you don't have any, don't hesitate to go alone!
